## Overview
Tired of never being able to keep track of how much water you've consumed? Always wondered how many hours you've slept this week? FitLit is here to help!

FitLit is an activity-tracking app that compiles and displays a user's data surrounding hydration, sleep, and their daily step goal. It was built using a previously-supplied data set with architectural and functionality requirements set by Turing School of Software and Design, following the principals of Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming.

## Setup
If you would like to pull down the code to your local machine, complete the following:
1. Make a copy of this repository by pressing the 'Fork' button in the upper right corner, and following the prompts
2. Pull your copy of the repository down to your local machine:
- On the remote repository's page, click the green 'Code' button, select SSH, and copy the URL
- Run `git clone <copied URL>` in your command line
-`cd` into the root directory
3. Run `npm install` in your command line to install the necessary dependencies

## Future Iterations
Moving forward, and after revisiting the script to refactor for DRYness and formatting, we plan to develop features for:
-compiling daily, weekly, and average 'step' data
-Allowing the user to customize their avatar
-Allowing the user to navigate to their friends' profiles
-Allowing the user to search for people by name or username
