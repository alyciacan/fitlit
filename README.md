## Overview
Tired of never being able to keep track of how much water üö∞ you've consumed, or how many steps üö∂üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è you've taken? Always wondered how many hours you've slept üò¥ this week? FitLit is here to help!

FitLit is an activity-tracking app that compiles and displays a user's data, including hydration, sleep, and daily step goal. It was built using a previously-supplied data set with architectural and functionality requirements set by Turing School of Software and Design, following the principals of Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming.

## Project Context
We are students in the Front-End Program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). Fitlit is our Mod 2 group project, which means we have been software developers for just under 2 months! üôå 

Learning Goals for this project included:      
‚úîÔ∏è Planning and writing ES6 classes      
‚úîÔ∏è Using object and array prototype methods to manipulate data        
‚úîÔ∏è Robust TDD          
‚úîÔ∏è Making network requests to retrieve data

## Technologies Used
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Javascript
+ Mocha
+ Chai
+ Webpack
+ API Fetch Requests
+ Chart.js

## Future Iterations
Moving forward, and after revisiting the script to refactor for DRYness and formatting, we plan to develop features for:
- Compiling daily, weekly, and average 'step' data
- Allowing the user to customize their avatar
- Allowing the user to navigate to their friends' profiles
- Allowing the user to search for people by name or username

## Dev Notes
### Wins
- Fully functional, interactive page
- Excellent group dynamic and communication
- Mostly-smooth git workflow
- Learning how to implement a dynamic chart widget
- Dynamic DOM manipulation functions

### Challenges
- Git error handling
- Balancing commit frequencies among group members
- Learning to format charts using the third party library
